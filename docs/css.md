# CSS

## File Structure

All the styling files are located in the `css` directory. We implement LESS as CSS pre-processor language. This provides with the following advantages:

 * Ability to use variables, mixins, nested rules, and operators
 * Distribute code among several files and directories to facilitate its maintenance
 * Load custom overrides if they exist

The main template style file is `css/styles.css`. This file is generated by processing `styles.less`. Refer to the [Installation and basic setup](https://github.com/Lyquix/tpl_lyquix/blob/master/docs/install.md) for initial steps you need to follow before you can successfully process `css/styles.less`.

You can see that `css/styles.less` does not include any style rules, it only loads other `.less` files that are part of the library. The last file loaded by `css/styles.less` is `css/custom/custom.less` which you can use to setup custom project styles.

If you explore any of the files loaded from `css/styles.less`, for example `css/less/02-colors.less` you can see that it loads other `.less` files with the same `02-colors` prefix, some from the files included in this library, and optionally, files in the `css/less/custom` directory that can be used to override the default rules.

In Joomla the default template styles are expected to be `css/templates.css`. Since this file is normally used also to provide styles in the HTML editor it is not recommended to include all the styles used on the site template. We have provided a `css/template.less` that includes a subset of styles that can be processed to provide styles for the HTML editor.

## Normalize

Rules that standardize browsers to equal base styling. Based on https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css.

## Colors

Defines the site branding colors. It creates several color variables that are reused throughout the library, and which you should use when writing your custom rules.

From the branding color, it generates additional variables with lighter and darker versions to provide a complete palette.

Creates variables used for assigning colors to HTML base elements. You should use these variables in your rules.

## Fonts

It loads a base Google Fonts: Open Sans (sans-serif), Playfair Display (serif), and Roboto Mono (monospace) to provide consistent look across devices even if no other custom fonts are defined.

Creates several variables for assigning fonts to HTML elements. You should use the same variables when creating your custom rules.

### Icon Fonts

The file `css/less/03-font-icons.less` is an icon fonts library that loads FontAwesome, IcoMoon, IonIcons, MapIcons, TypIcons, and WeatherIcons, and provides a consistent way to use all of them:

 * Use the class `.icon` in your HTML elements to set the basic icon styles.
 * Add the classes `.icon-lg` or `.icon-xl` for larger icons (32px and 64px)
 * Add the class for the specific icon, for example: `.fa-check` or `.ion-wifi`. You can find the complete set of icons in `css/icon-fonts.html`

 You can use the `.icon()` and any of the icon mixings in your custom rules, either directly on elements, or on the `:before` or `:after` pseudo-elements.
